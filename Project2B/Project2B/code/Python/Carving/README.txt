All parts of the assignment are complete. On a whiteboard, Zach Corse and I worked through the steps neccessary for this project.  

main.py:
I created a main.py file. You can run that to start the seam carving process. You can change the values of nr and nc from main.py. main.py imports an image and calls carv.py.  

carv.py:
carv.py creates the transport map and removes seams. carv.py returns the carved image Ic and the transport map T

In main.py, the original image and the carved image is then displayed. 

The images I used can be found in the "images" folder. My results can be found in the "results" folder. In main.py I have the nr and nc values I used commented out.
 
  # ben franklin
#  nr = 2
#  nc = 20
  
  # image from lecture slides
#  nr = 2
 # nc = 20

  # mom
 # nr = 10
 # nc = 15

  # plane
